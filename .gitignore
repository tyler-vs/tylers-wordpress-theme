# A demo of using a .gitignore file.
# this file tells git not to add or even track files
# that are specified in this gitignore file.
# usage includes:
# - prevent tracking of auto-generated or temporary files
# - avoid including files with private information
# 
# generally a good idea to set this file up near the 
# beginning of a project, to avoid accidently including
# unwanted files/folders
#
# patterns include:
# - any blank line or line starting with `#` are ignored
# - standard glob patterns work
# - start patterns with a `/` (forward slash) to avoid recursivity
# - end patterns with a `/` ( forward slash) to specify a directory
# - negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point `!`
